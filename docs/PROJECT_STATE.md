_Last updated: 2026-07-17 (**Phase 4 MERGED — PR [#85](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/85) merged to `main` via merge commit `8e1c2b0` (never squashed); branch deleted; local `main` synced.** All 6 CI checks passed. Baseline re-confirmed on `main`: `npm run test:run` → **766 passed / 78 files**. The UI/UX track is now complete through Phase 4 (the last scheduled UI/UX phase). **Next:** Phase 5 (choice-gating content model) is the final roadmap item — pull forward if content (The Orrery Room) resumes so new authoring uses the `hidden`/`disabled-with-reason` vocabulary from day one; otherwise content resumes with The Orrery Room (Grey Dawn vignette + `mythos-period-computed` consumer). Docs-only session; no code touched. — Prior update below.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-16 (**Phase 4 IMPLEMENTED — a11y hardening sweep shipped on `feat/phase4-a11y-sweep`; PR [#85](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/85) open (merge commit, never squash).** The last scheduled UI/UX phase (roadmap items 3/4/5 + preserve tests). **Real bugs fixed:** (1) opening Settings from the title left the background interactive — no `inert` wrapper (Codex spec Major 1); now `inert={isSettingsOpen}`, holds during the Suspense fallback. (2) **WCAG 2.4.3 focus-restore bug** the per-task jsdom reviews couldn't see — the `inert` ancestor blurs the invoker to `<body>` *before* `useFocusTrap` captures it, so ALL overlays (pre-existing, app-wide) restored focus to `<body>`; found by the whole-branch integration review, fixed by capturing the invoker at **open time** (`invokerRef` → `restoreFocusTo`), browser-confirmed focus now returns to the trigger. **Shipped:** SettingsPanel → shared `useFocusTrap` (Escape→window); ALL keyboard focus rings standardized to `focus-visible:ring-2 ring-amber-400` across ~11 components (2 documented exceptions), guarded by a glob-driven tree-wide inventory test; direct reduced-motion guards for every Motion gate (framer-motion prop-capture mock) + structural CSS guard; preserve regression tests (focus-restore ×4 overlays, save-toast roles, keyboard connect, dice-as-status). Full **file-based Codex spec/plan/impl passes all folded** (spec 4+3, plan 6+1, impl 3 — all test-quality false-green fixes: real focus-restore integration guard that simulates inert's blur, complete reduced-motion coverage incl. VitalityMeter/Hint-trigger, hardened ring inventory). Live-verified in-browser (ring visible dark+HC, inertness blocks background focus, reduced-motion zeroes CSS animation, focus restores to trigger; 0 console errors). Baseline **733/74 → 766/78** (+33). **Next:** merge PR #85 — Phase 5 (choice-gating content model) is the last roadmap item, or content resumes (The Orrery Room). — Prior update below.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-16 (**Phase 3 IMPLEMENTED — dice/probability legibility shipped on `feat/phase3-dice-legibility`; PR [#84](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/84) open (merge commit, never squash).** Faculty-check odds are now legible pre- and at-roll without a literal %: a diegetic **Prospects** band (Favourable/Uncertain/Forbidding) + DC + advantage on all three check surfaces (main choices, encounter round choices, scene clue prompts), `vs DC N` in the dice overlay, and an **"Assured"** treatment for guaranteed auto-succeed ability checks. New pure `checkOdds.ts` (band classifier + accessible phrase, RNG-free), shared decorative `CheckOddsTag` (`aria-hidden`; odds folded into each host button's own `aria-label`), a single `isFacultyCheck` type guard gating **both** the roll and every odds site (replaced ~6 drifted spellings), shared `checkAutoSucceeds`, `CheckResult.dc?` (transient, no migration; `loadGame` now clears `lastCheckResult`). **Partial-tier policy is data-driven for choices** (partial counts toward the band when it routes to the success/critical scene — ~43% of shipped checks). 8 TDD tasks + `isFacultyCheck` refactor, all per-task spec+quality reviewed; whole-branch review "ready to merge"; live-verified in-browser (band across 5 faculties, Assured beside an ordinary band, 0 console errors); **file-based Codex spec/plan/impl passes all folded** (spec 5, plan 9, impl 2 Majors — data-driven partial policy + stale-overlay-on-load). Baseline **684/64 → 733/74** (+49). **Next:** merge PR #84; then Phase 4 (a11y hardening sweep) per the roadmap. — Prior update below.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-16 (**Phase 2b IMPLEMENTED — deduction formation model shipped on `feat/phase2b-deduction-formation`; PR [#83](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/83) open (merge commit, never squash).** Enacts **ADR-0012** (`Accepted → Enacted`): correctness gates deduction formation, the Reason d20 only flavours it. All 8 TDD tasks landed: pure `deductionOracle.ts` (`classifyBoard` — recipes matched against player topology not `connectsTo`; generic path against undirected `connectsTo`; forms EVERY matched recipe, Blocker 1); board-owned oracle-driven formation, `DeductionButton` rolls only (no sticky lock); `'connected'` derived from membership via `ClueCard isConnected` (N1); store-owned contested-revert (timer registry + per-clue generation tokens, `contestClues`/`markCluesDeduced`/`cancelContestedReverts`, baseline-prior carry-forward); canonical stable generic-deduction id (no `Date.now`/`Math.random`, N5); validator reserves `deduction-generic-` namespace + enforces clue-id charset; save **v4→v5** (`connected`→`deduced`/`examined` recovery + all-versions `contested`→`examined` hygiene). Internal whole-branch review (Ready to merge) + **file-based Codex impl pass** (3 findings — null-clue-value migration guard, slack only failed edges, count-bearing mixed banner — all folded). Live-verified in-browser. Baseline **649/61 → 684/64** (+35). **Next:** merge PR #83; then Phase 3 (dice legibility) or Phase 4 (a11y sweep) per the roadmap. — Prior update below.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-15 (**Codex review → file-based (ADR-0013) + Phase 2a shipped — PR #82 merged (merge commit `63e4442`).** Two strands. (1) **Codex review procedure change:** replaced ADR-0010's MCP two-gate model (unreliable in-session Bedrock auth) with a **file-based** handoff at **three** checkpoints — spec, plan, completed implementation — via `codex/input`→`codex/output`; MCP `codex` tool retired for reviews (removed at user scope). **[ADR-0013](DECISIONS/ADR-0013-codex-file-based-review-handoff.md)** supersedes ADR-0010 (front-matter `superseded-by` + preserved banner per MADR immutability). (2) **Phase 2a — deduction feedback legibility** (roadmap items 6+2): `connected` 🔗 cue (WCAG 1.4.1) + board-owned outcome banner announced once via the Phase-1 `announce()` (fixes the button-unmount message loss) + directional partial-tier copy. **Legibility-only: formation unchanged, ADR-0012 NOT enacted.** The Phase 2 **spec took three Codex rounds** (each a real Blocker: tag-oracle unsound → recipe-only breaks the 4 vignettes → pre-existing board plumbing) resolving to a **2a-now / 2b-deferred split**; plan (5 findings) + impl (1 Major mobile-clip bug, live-fixed) each passed their own pass. Full review trail in `codex/`. Baseline **635/60 → 649/61** (+14). **Next:** Phase 2b (formation oracle, enacts ADR-0012, fixes the `contested`-revert latent bug — full analysis in the spec's Part B), or Phase 3/4 per the roadmap. — Prior update below.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-14 (**UI/UX track opened + Phase 1 shipped — two docs-only PRs and one feature PR this run.** (1) PR #79 (merged): deep-research reference [`ui-ux-improvements.md`](research/ui-ux-improvements.md) (24 sources, adversarially verified) + a code-checked repo audit that corrected the research prompt's wrong premises (evidence board is click-select, not drag; dice/save/case-select are status/toast/route, not modals); track-C roadmap [`ui-ux-roadmap.md`](research/ui-ux-roadmap.md); and [ADR-0012](DECISIONS/ADR-0012-deduction-roll-semantics.md) (Phase-0 decision — deduction roll flavours, correctness gates; Accepted, enacts in Phase 2). (2) **PR #80 (open): Phase 1 — global live announcer.** New `src/announcer.ts` external store (polite/assertive channels, two-slot re-announce, ready+pre-mount queue, cached snapshot) + `<LiveAnnouncer>` (four always-mounted `sr-only` `aria-live` nodes, per-mount empty-commit gate), mounted at root in `main.tsx` outside `ErrorBoundary`. Pure substrate — no store-subscription, no existing `aria-live` region touched. Full gate pipeline: design Gate 1 (5 findings), plan Gate 1 (4 findings), per-task spec+quality reviews, code Gate 2 (round 1: remount bug + test gap fixed; round 2: "sound to merge"). Baseline **611/58 → 635/60** (+24). Codex handoff now a committed `codex/` dir (input/output); pattern documented in CLAUDE.md. **Next:** merge PR #79/#80 (merge commit, never squash); then Phase 2 (deduction feedback legibility) consumes `announce()` + enacts ADR-0012. On #80 merge: fix the roadmap Phase-1 row (says `AccessibilityProvider`; actual mount is `main.tsx`) and flip `ui-ux-improvements.md`'s "announcer ⭕ absent" rows to done.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-12 (**The Comet Club authored — fourth main case, flagship scale ([ADR-0011](DECISIONS/ADR-0011-comet-club-fourth-main-case.md)), on PR #76 awaiting merge.** Built from the ideation doc's #1 pick via spec → Codex-gated plan → subagent-driven execution (7 implementer tasks, per-task reviews, 3 fix cycles) → content-integrity review → whole-branch review → Codex Gate 2 (1 MAJOR caught: a fixer mis-reported a flag removal; fixed, round-2 PASS). Catalog now **8 cases / 276 scenes / 74 clues / 40 NPCs**; the-comet-club = 75 scenes (67 base + 8 variants) / 16 clues / 10 NPCs / 4 deduction recipes. `mythos-period-computed` breadcrumb live (consumer: future Orrery Room). Baseline re-verified this session: **611/58 tests, lint clean, validator zero errors/warnings (8 cases)**; `node_modules` reinstalled. Next: merge PR #76 (merge commit, never squash), then The Orrery Room is the natural next build.)_

_Prior update: 2026-07-11, fourth session (**context7 MCP scope conflict fixed — `.mcp.json`'s context7 entry switched from stdio `npx @upstash/context7-mcp` to the HTTP endpoint `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`, and the duplicate user-scope registration removed (machine-local `~/.claude.json`), so the repo-shareable project scope (ADR-0004) is the single definition on the modern endpoint. First task run through the new ADR-0010 gates: Gate 1 caught a real ordering hazard (don't remove the working user entry before validating the project one — plan reordered), Gate 2 clean. Note: project-scope MCP servers show a one-time "Pending approval" trust prompt on next launch (same as playwright/github). Baseline 611/58 + 201/7 stands; `npm ci` still needed before next code session.**) — Prior (below, same day): Codex review gates (ADR-0010).

_Prior update: 2026-07-11, third session (**Codex integrated as cross-provider adversarial reviewer — two mandatory review gates ([ADR-0010](DECISIONS/ADR-0010-codex-adversarial-review-gates.md)). Machine-side was already in place (Codex CLI 0.144.1 via brew, ChatGPT auth, user-scope `codex` MCP server, read-only sandbox verified by `codex doctor`; model `gpt-5.6-sol` smoke-tested working). Repo-side: CLAUDE.md gained the "Adversarial review with Codex" section — Gate 1: every non-trivial task's plan reviewed before any mutation; Gate 2: complete task diff vs. starting base reviewed before completion, run before `/checkpoint` (mechanical spine updates exempt). The gate text itself went through both Codex review rounds: round 1 found 5 loopholes (user approved the hardened variant), round 2 confirmed 4 fixed + 1 residual (untracked files; fixed with intent-to-add wording). Both gates verified live through the MCP tool — Gate 1 caught a real repo-specific trap (exact faction-key string). Docs-only in-repo; baseline 611/58 + 201/7 stands (`npm ci` still needed before next code session).**)
**Standing rule (ADR-0013, supersedes ADR-0010):** cross-provider Codex review is a **file-based** handoff (`codex/input` → `codex/output`) at three checkpoints — spec, plan, completed implementation; the `codex` MCP tool is not used for reviews (removed at user scope 2026-07-14); reviewer unavailable → announce prominently, never silently skip. — Prior (below, same day): CLAUDE.md pointer-map trim.

_Prior update: 2026-07-11, second session (**CLAUDE.md trimmed to a pointer map — 339 → 165 lines ([ADR-0009](DECISIONS/ADR-0009-claude-md-pointer-doctrine.md)). A claude-md-improver audit scored it 78/100 with ~40% restating `docs/`-owned facts (the source of 17 drift-fix commits since 2026-07-07); the user approved the full trim. Engine Behaviour → `engine-reference.md`, Component Hierarchy → `architecture.md`, Current Content → `status.md`, Key Types / slice table / Character System / Tailwind Theme / completed A–E roadmap cut, onEnter explanation deduped (Warnings copy kept). Kept in full: doc map, memory-spine protocol, two-domain rule, Commands, store Rules, authoring non-negotiables, Testing, CI/CD (incl. no-squash), all Architectural Warnings. Repointed the two references into removed sections (this file's tracker legend; `docs/README.md` blurb). Docs-only; baseline 611/58 + 201/7 stands (node_modules still absent — `npm ci` before next code session).**)
**Standing rule (ADR-0009):** don't re-add `docs/`-owned reference detail to CLAUDE.md — the sweep's duplication check now treats that as drift. — Prior (below, same day): spine sync to the updated portable guide.

_Prior update: 2026-07-11 (**Memory-spine sync to the updated portable guide — docs/config only, no code or content touched. The upstream `portable-memory-spine.md` guide (JonWhiteFang/Documents) took two updates today: a hardening pass and a MADR 4.x ADR-template modernization; this session brought the repo's implementation in line. Baseline 611/58 + 201/7 stands from 2026-07-09 (not re-run — `node_modules` still absent locally; run `npm ci` before the next code session).**)
**This session (spine sync):** (1) **ADR template → MADR 4.x** — `DECISIONS/ADR-TEMPLATE.md` now uses YAML front matter (`status/date/deciders/phase/supersedes/superseded-by`) and gains a **Confirmation** section (names the concrete check proving a decision is still enacted); all 8 existing ADRs had their metadata bullet blocks converted to the same front matter (values preserved verbatim; decision bodies untouched per the immutability rule); `DECISIONS/README.md` gained the front-matter "How to add" steps and the precise immutability rule (decision content frozen; front matter / Confirmation / Links / index row are the mutable pointers). (2) **Hardening-pass fixes** — "append-only" → **"prepend-only"** RUN_LOG terminology (RUN_LOG header, `docs/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`); `/checkpoint` skill step order corrected to sweep → **ADR → STATE → RUN_LOG** → report, supersessions now routed via front matter + index, step 6 gains the spine-rides-along-with-the-work commit expectation, and guardrails gain the report-only sweep variant + the branch/multi-agent conflict protocol. Deliberate leave-alone: ADR-0002's body still says "append-only" — frozen point-in-time record. — Prior (below): content ideation.

_Earlier: 2026-07-10 (**Content ideation — ran `docs/content-ideas-prompt.md` and wrote [`content-ideas-2026-07-10.md`](content-ideas-2026-07-10.md): 10 new concepts (6 main cases + 4 vignettes), top-3 ranking, a full pitch for The Comet Club, and a staged optional Mythos thread. Docs-only; no code or content touched; baseline 611/58 stands from 2026-07-09 (not re-run — `node_modules` absent locally, see flag below).**)
**This session (ideation):** executed the repo's ideation prompt against full project context (design bible, authoring guide, manifest, all 7 metas). Deliverable highlights: **The Comet Club** ranked #1 (closed-circle astronomers dying in 1882 seating order; double solution — one human tontine murder hidden inside an inhuman pattern; zero new engine needs); **The Ravenscroft Remedy** #2 (activates the unused Ravenscroft Asylum; a Veil-memory-excising "cure" that works); **The Orrery Room** #3 (fills the objectively missing **Grey Dawn faction vignette** gap). Mythos thread staged across 6 breadcrumb flags + one keystone `KeyDeduction` (`mythos-pattern-named`, mintable only in The Orrery Room) — all expressible with existing flag/recipe/variant machinery; suggested build order Comet Club → Orrery Room → Drowned Archive → Tidewaiter's Log. **Sweep fixes:** root `README.md` had survived the PR #69 sweep stale — play URL (github.io → `holodeck.jonwhitefang.uk`), 198→201 scenes, React 18→19, Tailwind → v4, and the CI section's "deploys to GitHub Pages" claim (→ build-compiles check, deploy Cloudflare-side); `docs/README.md` doc map gained the two content-ideas docs. **Flag:** `node_modules` is missing locally (validator/tests could not run this session); content is unchanged since the 2026-07-09 verified counts (611 tests / 58 files / 201 scenes / 7 cases), so those stand — run `npm ci` before the next code session. — Prior (below): #52 interview.

_Earlier: 2026-07-09 (**Answered the issue #52 agent-perspective interview — posted as a comment on the GitHub issue (NOT committed to the repo). This checkpoint's spine/doc edits are the only committed change; no code/content touched, test baseline unchanged 611.**)
**Prior session (interview):** the user asked the agent to answer **issue #52** — an interview addressed to Claude Code for a jonwhitefang.uk blog post on how G&G was built. Ran a fan-out research workflow (8 per-cluster researchers, every claim grounded in git/gh/ADR/RUN_LOG citations; the fact-check phase largely stalled on agent timeouts but returned zero corrections, and every load-bearing figure was independently re-verified by the lead against primary sources). Posted a first-person, candour-over-polish answer to all 11 questions ([issue #52, comment 4926364394](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/issues/52#issuecomment-4926364394)). **Central honesty findings the blog must not get wrong** (surfaced so future sessions don't re-derive them): the project began under **Kiro** (a different AI IDE) at the 2026-02-19 initial commit `be92632` — the design bible, 4 archetypes, 4 factions, the deduction system, the entire Phase A–E foundation, and the "198 scenes" content uplift (`50df7a1`, 2026-02-25) all **predate Claude Code**, which only took over on 2026-07-07 (`4707828`); the issue's "198 scenes" is a stale Kiro-era commit-title figure (live: **201 base / 215 runtime**, per F-120); there were **two** audits (67→22 issues + 23→8), not one; the deduction mechanic was **activated** (stable ids + content), not built; and the human/agent division of labour is invisible in git (every non-bot commit authored "Jon White"). The interview itself changed no repo files — comment-only. — Prior (below): full doc-drift sweep + audit relocation (PR #69).

_Earlier: 2026-07-09 (**Full-doc-drift sweep + audit-file relocation — docs-only (PR #69, merged). 21 verified drift fixes across 8 docs; moved `2026-07-09_ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/audits/`. Test baseline unchanged 611; no code touched.**)
**Prior session (doc sweep):** ran a fan-out audit (9 per-doc auditors + historical link-check, each finding adversarially verified against source) → **21 CONFIRMED drift fixes**, all applied. Highlights: engine-reference `CaseCompletionResult.vignettesUnlocked: string[]` + `checkVignetteUnlocks(): string[]` (were singular/nullable — F-057 drift); the "no audio ships / silent" claim corrected in **4 docs** (9 SFX now ship); CLAUDE.md scene-count parenthetical fixed (201 = base+variants **excl.** shared; 215 at runtime), `haltScenes.ts` added to the engine list, `CaseCompletion`/`InvestigationHalted` added to the component hierarchy; content-JSON described as wrapped objects not bare arrays; a dead `build→deploy` CI ref, two stale `file:line`s in architecture.md, `66→67` validator example, doc-map missing `audio-asset-kit.md`, and several stale audio-status lines. **Also moved** the 2026-07-09 audit report from repo root into `docs/audits/` (via `git mv`, history preserved) beside the 2026-07-07 audit; repointed the 4 live PROJECT_STATE links (`../` → `audits/`) + the RUN_LOG history href (annotated, not rewritten). All 85 internal doc links resolve; validator clean (7 cases). — Prior (below): #60 CI type-check (PR #68).

_Earlier: 2026-07-09 (**Audit-2 P3 #60 FIXED — CI type-checks scripts/ + vite.config.ts (PR #68, merged). ENTIRE audit-2 code backlog (#53–#60) CLEAR.**)
**#60 (F-123):** the build gate's `tsc` had `include: ["src"]`, so `scripts/` — incl. `scripts/validateCase.ts`, the
content-validator source that is itself a CI correctness gate — was in no tsconfig; a type regression there passed the build
and only surfaced at runtime via the vite-node shim. `vite.config.ts` was nominally covered by `tsconfig.node.json` but that
project had no `lib`, so `tsc -b` reported `TS2550` on its `String.includes`. Fix: new **`tsconfig.scripts.json`**
(non-composite + `noEmit` — so unlike the composite `tsconfig.node.json` it avoids `TS6310` and emits no litter; `lib: ES2023`,
`types: ["node"]`) covering `scripts/**/*.ts` + `vite.config.ts`; new `typecheck:scripts` npm script chained into `build`
between `tsc` and `vite build`; `tsconfig.node.json` given explicit `target ES2022`/`lib ES2023` to fix the `TS2550` at root;
`@types/node@^20` devDep (pinned to the `.nvmrc` Node-20 line). Verified the issue's own check: a `const x: string = 42` in
the validator made `npm run build` exit 0 before, exit 2 after (same for a `vite.config.ts` error). **CI round-trip:** the
first push failed `npm ci` on the **emnapi lockfile trap** ([[dependabot-major-group-migration]]) — local Node v25/npm 11
re-resolved the optional `@emnapi/*` ranges to 1.11.2 vs CI's Node-20 1.11.1; fixed by a clean `rm -rf node_modules
package-lock.json && npm install` regen + `npm ci` verify (memory note updated). Test baseline unchanged **611**; all six CI
checks passed on PR #68. Doc-drift sweep: `CLAUDE.md` Commands (build tsc scope + `typecheck:scripts`) + CI/CD `build`-job
description. **Audit-2 code backlog: CLEAR (#53–#60 all done). Only #20 (media, user-blocked) + #52 (interview) remain open.**
— Prior (below): #59 test quality (PR #67).

Earlier this session: **Audit-2 P2 #59 FIXED — test quality (PR #67, merged).**
**#59 (F-112–F-116 + 2 correctness cross-check gaps):** seven test-quality defects, one **test-only** PR — the 588-test
suite was green while several invariants had zero real guards (tests exercised copies of logic, transitive paths, or asserted
nothing about the behaviour they were named for). Every new/rewritten test was **mutation-verified**: the real production
code was broken, the test watched to fail (the honest RED for already-correct code), then restored — so **no production code
changed** (`git diff` on non-test `src/**` is empty). **F-112** `npcBounds.property` drove local clamp COPIES — now calls the
real `adjustDisposition`/`adjustSuspicion` and asserts the store clamps. **F-113** new `worldSlice.reputation` real-slice ±10
boundary tests (was only `vi.fn()`-mocked). **F-114** Nerve-vs-Lore reaction tiebreak (tie + strict cases; flipping `>=`→`>`
fails only the tie). **F-115** new direct `resolveScene` variant tests (was only transitive, all `variants: []`). **F-116**
rewrote the eviction test with deterministic timestamps — asserts the OLDEST manual save is evicted and autosave is protected
(was asserting a list length only). **flag path** `applyEffects` result assertions (was "does not throw"; the `?? true`→`|| true`
mutation that coerces `false`→`true` now fails). **mundane vitality-only** encounter damage branch (+ both-deltas exclusivity).
Test baseline **588→611** (+23, 56→58 files); lint + validator (7 cases) + build green; all six CI checks passed on PR #67.
Doc-drift sweep: `status.md` baseline 588→611, files 56→58. **Audit-2 code backlog remaining: #60 (P3) — no P0/P1/P2 left.**
— Prior (below): #57 a11y/error-messaging (PR #66).

Earlier this session: **Audit-2 P1 #57 FIXED — a11y & error-messaging (PR #66, merged). All P1 now cleared.**
**#57 (F-007-regression + 2 new):** three a11y/error-messaging defects, one PR. **inert regression** — `App` passed the
React-18 idiom `inert: ''`, but React 19 treats `inert` as a real boolean attribute and an empty string is falsy → react-dom
`removeAttribute`s it, silently defeating the modal-background isolation (F-007); 3 of 4 overlays have no independent Tab trap
and relied on it. Fixed to `inert={anyOverlayOpen}` (verified in a real browser: attribute set + background focus blocked).
**ErrorBoundary false auto-save** — the fallback claimed "your progress has been auto-saved" unconditionally, but Manual save
mode never writes an autosave slot; now gated on `SaveManager.listSaves()` actually holding an `autosave`. **Unannounced
loading** — `OverlayFallback` + the "Loading case…" screen were visual-only; added `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`.
**Bonus:** hardened `evaluateCondition` record lookups with an own-property guard (`ownValue`) so a gate target naming an
`Object.prototype` member (`toString`/`valueOf`/…) can't read the inherited property — this was the root cause of a
**pre-existing flaky determinism property test** (failed ~1/7 full-suite runs on `main`; now 20/20 clean). TDD (RED watched).
Test baseline **577→588**; lint + validator (7 cases) + build green; all six CI checks passed on PR #66. Doc-drift sweep:
`status.md` baseline 577→588. **Audit-2 code backlog remaining: #59 (P2), #60 (P3) — no P0/P1 left.** — Prior (below): #55
save/reload safety (PR #65).

Earlier this session: **Audit-2 P1 #55 FIXED — save/reload safety (PR #65, merged).**
**#55 (F-103/F-105):** two persistence-safety defects. **F-103** — manual `saveGame` had no try/catch (autoSave did), so a
`localStorage` throw (quota/private-browsing) became an unhandled rejection while the UI showed "Game saved"; now returns
`{ ok:false }` and App shows a `role="alert"` error toast. **F-105** — encounter reaction-check damage re-rolled on
save/reload because `EncounterState` was component-only + unpersisted; now `encounterState` lives in the store + save (v3→v4
migration, defaults null), `EncounterPanel` resumes a persisted in-progress encounter instead of re-running `startEncounter`,
and `goToScene`/`resetForNewCase` clear it. TDD (RED watched). Test baseline **569→577**; lint + validator (7 cases) + build
green; all six CI checks passed on PR #65. Doc-drift sweep: `status.md` baseline 569→577; save version 3→4 + the v3→v4
migration step in `CLAUDE.md` + `engine-reference.md`; `encounterState`/`setEncounterState` added to the narrativeSlice
rows (`CLAUDE.md` + `architecture.md`); the `saveGame` try/catch noted. **Audit-2 code backlog remaining: #57 (P1),
#59 (P2), #60 (P3).** — Prior (below): #56 scene-transition hygiene (PR #64).

Earlier this session: **Audit-2 P1 #56 FIXED — scene-transition state hygiene (PR #64, merged).**
**#56 (F-118/F-104/F-106/F-108):** four defects on the `goToScene`/`resetForNewCase` seam, one PR. The once-per-scene
`onEnter` gate now keys on the **resolved** scene id (base or variant), so a variant's distinct `onEnter` fires once when
newly eligible (F-118) while still never re-firing (F-006 preserved); `resetForNewCase` clears `currentScene` so no foreign
id leaks into the new `sceneHistory` (F-104); `goToScene` clears `lastCheckResult` on cross-scene nav so the dice overlay
can't leak forward (F-106); `App` uses a reactive `canGoBack` selector (F-108, with an App-level integration test driving
the real new-game flow). TDD (RED watched). Test baseline **564→569**; lint + validator (7 cases) + build green; all six
CI checks passed on PR #64. Doc-drift sweep: `status.md` baseline 564→569; the `onEnter`/`visitedScenes` behaviour notes
in `CLAUDE.md` + `architecture.md` now say "resolved scene id" (F-118) + note the F-104/F-106 resets; `engine-reference.md`
`validateBundle` now documents the F-102 gated-deduction reachability error + `computeNonCriticalReachableScenes` (drift
from #54). **Audit-2 code backlog remaining: #55/#57 (P1), #59 (P2), #60 (P3).** — Prior (below): both P0s (#53 PR #62, #54 PR #63).

Earlier this session: **Both audit-2 P0 gameplay blockers FIXED — #53 (PR #62) + #54 (PR #63), both merged.**
**#54 (F-102):** the Mayfair true ending was gated behind a key deduction whose 3 clues were only gatherable via two
nat-20 rolls (~0.25%) — an RNG lottery. Fix dual-sources the two crit-gated clues onto non-critical sibling scenes
(`ms-clue-vesper-journal` → `ms-act2-occult-partial`; `ms-clue-hidden-mechanism` → `ms-act1-room-partial`, perception≥11
check) so a skilled no-crit occult run forms the deduction (verified by simulation + the content-integrity reviewer, clean).
Added a **validator guard** (per-tier reachability: every clue a *gated* recipe needs must be obtainable off the
non-critical scene graph — errored on Mayfair pre-fix; the follow-up the audit asked for). **#53 (F-101/F-107, PR #62):**
archetype auto-succeed ability now consumed once via a shared `resolveCheckOutcome` both check paths call. TDD throughout
(RED watched). Test baseline **554→564**; lint + validator (7 cases) + build green; all six CI checks passed on both PRs.
Doc-drift sweep: `status.md` baseline 558→564 + validator-check list; `content-authoring.md` key-deduction rule (F-102
now validator-enforced); engine-reference/CLAUDE.md `resolveCheckOutcome` (from #53). **Audit-2 code backlog remaining:
#55/#56/#57 (P1), #59 (P2), #60 (P3) — no P0 left.** — Prior (below): #58 doc-drift (PR #61); the audit itself.
Second full Ultracode repo audit — analysis only, no code changed. Ran the
command battery (all green — 554 tests, lint, validator, build, 0 npm vulns) then an orchestrated 13-dimension
adversarial fan-out (71 agents) + lead verification. 37 raw → **23 root-cause-deduped verified findings** (new IDs
**F-101…F-123**, distinct from the prior F-001…F-067); 4 rejected as false positives. Report:
[`2026-07-09_ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md`](audits/2026-07-09_ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md) (`docs/audits/`). Overall
risk **Medium**. Filed **8 grouped GitHub issues (#53–#60)**: two **P0** gameplay blockers — **#53** archetype
auto-succeed ability never consumed (auto-crits every same-faculty check all case; F-101/F-107) and **#54** Mayfair
true ending RNG-locked behind two nat-20s (F-102) — plus P1 save/reload safety (#55), scene-transition state hygiene
(#56), a11y/error-messaging incl. a React-19 `inert=''` regression (#57), docs-drift incl. `architecture.md` documenting
the F-006 anti-pattern (#58), P2 test-quality (#59), P3 CI type-checking (#60). **This reopens the audit backlog**
(previously "cleared except #20"). Test baseline **554** (unchanged; 56 files — no code touched). Removed two stray
build artifacts (`vite.config.js`/`.d.ts`) `tsconfig.node.json`'s `composite:true` emitted during the audit build; the
`.gitignore` gap that let them appear is flagged for follow-up. Prior (same day): PR #51 dep major-group migration
(ADR-0008); #47 Cloudflare Worker deploy (ADR-0007).)_

## Current position

- **Stage:** Phases A–E complete and the game is playable end-to-end (**8 cases on `main`**; The Comet Club merged via PR #76). The full UI/UX track (Phases 0–4) is also complete. The **first** audit's backlog
  (#1–#22, findings F-001…F-067) is fully cleared except **#20 (media assets)**. **Second audit (2026-07-09) backlog
  #53–#60 (F-101…F-123): CLEAR — both P0 gameplay blockers FIXED (#53 auto-succeed PR #62, #54 Mayfair true ending
  PR #63); all P1 FIXED (#55 save/reload PR #65, #56 scene-transition PR #64, #57 a11y/errors PR #66, #58 docs PR #61);
  P2 #59 test quality FIXED (PR #67); P3 #60 CI type-check `scripts/` FIXED (PR #68).** No audit-2 code items left.
  See the audit report + the issues. **Non-code #52 (agent-perspective interview) answered** on the issue 2026-07-09.
- **Deployment:** **Cloudflare static-assets Worker** at `holodeck.jonwhitefang.uk/gaslight-and-grimoire/*` (GitHub
  Pages retired, ADR-0007). Config in-repo: `wrangler.jsonc` (assets-only), `public/_headers` (real CSP header incl.
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`), `scripts/nest-for-cloudflare.mjs` (postbuild nests `dist/*` under the route prefix, keeps
  `_headers` at root). Cloudflare git-connects the repo and builds `main` on push; Cloudflare-side setup is owner-managed.
- **Active gate:** CI enforces it. Every push/PR to `main` runs `npm run lint` + the validator + `npm run test:run` in
  the `test` job; `build` (build-compiles check, **no publish** now) depends on it — and its `tsc` step now also
  type-checks `scripts/` + `vite.config.ts` via `tsconfig.scripts.json` (F-123). CI installs run
  `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (F-038). Bar unchanged locally: lint + test suite green + validator clean before merge.
- **Dependencies:** All npm majors current **except TypeScript** (held at 5.x — TS 7 blocked until `typescript-eslint`
  drops its `<6.1.0` peer cap). Runtime: React 19, framer-motion 12, zustand 5, immer 11. Toolchain: Vite 8 (Rolldown),
  Vitest 4, jsdom 29, Tailwind 4 (CSS-first `@theme`), ESLint 10. See ADR-0008 + [[dependabot-major-group-migration]] for
  the clustering approach and the emnapi lockfile gotcha.
- **Branch focus:** none — on `main` at `8e1c2b0`, clean. **Phase 4 (a11y sweep) MERGED — PR
  [#85](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/85)** (merge commit `8e1c2b0`, never squashed;
  branch deleted); gate green (766/78, lint, validator 8/8, build). The UI/UX track is complete through Phase 4.
  Prior branches merged: #84 (Phase 3), #83 (Phase 2b), #82 (Phase 2a), #76 (Comet Club), #79/#80 (UI/UX Phase 0/1).
  All audit backlogs cleared except #20 (media, user-blocked). **Next code work:** Phase 5 (choice-gating content
  model) or content resumes (The Orrery Room) — no branch open.
- **Verification:** 2026-07-09 — on merged `main`: `npm run test:run` → **611 passed (611)** across **58** files;
  `npm run lint` clean, validator clean (7 cases), `npm ci --ignore-scripts` + `npm run build` green (build now also
  type-checks `scripts/` + `vite.config.ts`; emits `dist/gaslight-and-grimoire/` + `dist/_headers`). **CI green on PR #68**
  (and #62–#67) — all six checks pass on each, including the **Cloudflare Workers Build**. This session (interview) touched
  **no code or content** — the answer was posted to GitHub issue #52, not the repo — so the 611/58 baseline holds unchanged;
  re-verified live this session: `npm run test:run` → **611 passed (611)** / 58 files, `node scripts/validateCase.mjs` →
  **201 scenes / 7 cases** clean. **2026-07-10 (ideation session):** docs-only again — no code/content touched, so 611/58
  and 201/7 continue to stand; nothing re-run this session because `node_modules` is absent locally (`npm ci` needed before
  the next code session). **2026-07-11 (spine sync):** docs/`.claude` config only — no code/content touched, `node_modules`
  still absent, so the same baseline continues to stand. **2026-07-11 second session (CLAUDE.md trim):** likewise docs-only;
  same baseline stands. **2026-07-12 (Comet Club, on PR #76 branch):** `node_modules` reinstalled; on `docs/comet-club-spec`
  at `c967878`: `npm run test:run` → **611 passed (611)** / 58 files, `npm run lint` clean,
  `node scripts/validateCase.mjs` → **276 scenes / 8 cases**, zero errors and zero warnings. **2026-07-14 (Phase 1
  announcer, PR #80):** 611/58 → **635/60**. **2026-07-15 (Phase 2a, PR #82 merged `63e4442`):** on merged `main` —
  `npm run test:run` → **649 passed (649)** / **61** files, `npm run lint` clean, `node scripts/validateCase.mjs` →
  **8 cases** clean, `npm run build` green. CI on PR #82: all green except OWASP Dependency-Check, which failed on an
  external **NPM Audit API outage** (not a vulnerability, not a required check, zero dep changes in the PR) — merged per
  user direction. **2026-07-16 (Phase 2b spec + plan):** docs-only — no code/content touched, so the **649/61** baseline
  held. **2026-07-16 (Phase 2b implementation, PR #83):** on `feat/phase2b-deduction-formation` at `4e2412d` —
  `npm run test:run` → **684 passed (684)** / **64** files, `npm run lint` clean, `node scripts/validateCase.mjs`
  → **8 cases** clean, `npm run build` green. Live-verified in-browser (The Whitechapel Cipher): correctness-gated
  formation on a real roll, derived connected cue on a `deduced` clue, baseline-prior revert, repeat attempts,
  zero console errors. Internal whole-branch review + Codex impl pass (3 findings) both folded. **2026-07-16 (Phase 3,
  PR #84):** on `feat/phase3-dice-legibility` at `d121e9b` — `npm run test:run` → **733 passed (733)** / **74** files
  (was 684/64, +49), `npm run lint` clean, `node scripts/validateCase.mjs` → **8 cases** clean, `npm run build` green.
  Live-verified in-browser (The Whitechapel Cipher, Deductionist): Prospects band across 5 faculties, odds folded into
  each button's accessible name, non-check choices show no DC, and the **Assured** treatment renders for a Reason check
  while the Elementary auto-succeed ability is active — side-by-side with an ordinary Nerve band; zero console errors.
  Whole-branch review "ready to merge" + Codex spec (5) / plan (9) / impl (2 Majors) passes all folded. **2026-07-16
  (Phase 4 a11y sweep, PR #85):** on `feat/phase4-a11y-sweep` at `591d9b2` — `npm run test:run` → **766 passed (766)**
  / **78** files (was 733/74, +33), `npm run lint` clean, `node scripts/validateCase.mjs` → **8 cases** clean,
  `npm run build` green. Live-verified in-browser (Playwright): keyboard focus ring visible (amber `oklch(0.828…)` box-shadow)
  on the dark theme AND in high-contrast mode; opening Settings marks the title `inert` and blocks background focus;
  closing Settings restores focus to the trigger button (NOT `<body>` — the WCAG 2.4.3 fix, confirmed the pre-fix path
  landed on `<body>`); the `.reduced-motion` class zeroes CSS `animation/transition-duration`; zero console errors.
  Per-task spec+quality reviews + whole-branch integration review (surfaced the focus-restore bug) + Codex spec/plan/impl
  (4+3 / 6+1 / 3) all folded; impl pass was 3 test-quality false-green fixes (production code confirmed sound).

## Phase / milestone tracker

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done & verified · `[!]` blocked.
Source of truth for each phase's scope: [status.md](status.md) (systems present + current-state detail; the phases' original roadmap was retired from CLAUDE.md 2026-07-11 — all complete).

| # | Title | Status | Notes |
|--:|-------|:------:|-------|
| A | Foundation (loadGame fix, snapshot dedupe, hint wiring, ability fix, validation, firstScene) | `[x]` | Complete |
| B | Core refactoring (pure `computeChoiceResult`, engine↔store decoupled, audio subscription, runtime content validation) | `[x]` | Complete; engine has zero store imports |
| C | Gap filling (ClueDiscoveryCard, save button, faction display, error display, completion screen) | `[x]` | Complete |
| D | Integration (encounter UI, stale-state cleanup, dead-code removal) | `[x]` | Complete |
| E | Game design (active clue discovery, consequence feedback, Veil Sight, recovery, persistent evidence board, faction clamping, CI validation, NPC dialogue, scene history, testing + content depth) | `[x]` | Complete |
| — | Docs rebuild (lean `docs/` set: architecture, engine-reference, content-authoring, status, README) | `[x]` | Complete (recent commits) |
| — | Committed memory spine (this system) | `[x]` | STATE + RUN_LOG + DECISIONS + hook + `/checkpoint`; synced 2026-07-11 to the updated portable guide (MADR 4.x front matter + Confirmation, prepend-only wording, checkpoint step order) |
| — | CLAUDE.md trim to pointer map | `[x]` | **ADR-0009**, 2026-07-11: 339→165 lines; `docs/`-owned reference detail must not be restated in CLAUDE.md (sweep enforces) |
| — | Codex adversarial-review gates | `[x]` | **ADR-0013** (2026-07-15, supersedes **ADR-0010**): file-based cross-provider review (`codex/input`→`codex/output`) at three checkpoints — spec, plan, completed implementation; MCP `codex` tool retired for reviews. ADR-0010's original MCP two-gate model no longer operative. First exercised end-to-end on Phase 2a (PR #82). |
| — | Content-authoring automation layer | `[x]` | ADR-0004: `PostToolUse` hook, `content-integrity-reviewer` subagent, `/new-scene` + `/review-content`, `context7`/`github` MCP |
| — | Full Ultracode repo audit + backlog | `[x]` | Report in `docs/audits/`; 67 findings → **22 issues** (5 P0/7 P1/7 P2/3 P3) |
| Q | Audit remediation — P0 blockers | `[x]` | **5/5 done**: CI gate #1 + quick-wins #11 (PR #24); validators #2 + Debt of Smoke #3 (PR #25); encounter escape #4 + onEnter idempotency #5, +F-022/F-027 (PR #28). |

| Q3′ | Audit remediation — remaining P2 | `[x]` | **Complete — PR #37** (`dd53816`). #15 (ESLint + lint CI, Node pin, dep drop, audit off deploy, Dependabot), #16 (`useGameState`/`useShallow` selector fix + lazy overlays + vendor chunks; entry 410→92 KB), #17 (CLAUDE.md drift + root README). +2 tests. |
| Q4 | Audit remediation — P3 #21 hardening | `[x]` | **Complete — PR #45** (`d57b41a`). F-057 (all vignettes unlock, not just first), F-036 (save-load shape guard), F-052 (save toast + eviction warn), F-054 (two-tap delete confirm), F-055 (load indicator), F-037 (CSP residuals documented), F-038 (`--ignore-scripts` in CI). 524→547 tests. |
| — | Docs — engine-reference rewrite for narrativeEngine split | `[x]` | **PR #44** (`472ef32`). Documents the 4 split modules + advantage/flags/constants/haltScenes; fixed save-version/`lastCriticalFaculty`/`save()`-signature drift. Cleared the last flagged doc item. |
| M | Media assets — audio (.mp3) + illustrations + NPC portraits | `[~]` | **Strategy set (ADR-0006)**; prompt kit authored. **9 SFX shipped + normalized + verified loading in-browser** (fixed 2 blockers found in QA). **Pending:** 10 ambient loops; perceptual SFX QA (human ears); `checkAudioAssets.mjs` + CI. **Illustrations parked** (lowest priority). Issue #20. |
| P | Audit remediation — P3 #22 polish (perf + a11y) | `[x]` | **Complete — PR #46** (`1ac3c09`). F-044 rAF-throttle EvidenceBoard, F-045 `useShallow`+`React.memo` list items, F-046 LazyMotion (motion chunk 121.85→79.13 KB), F-047 shared-scene cache, F-048 reduced-motion gating, F-049 focusable typewriter-skip + sr-region, F-050 WCAG contrast, F-051 skip-link. 547→554 tests. |
| — | Deployment — Cloudflare Worker migration (retire GitHub Pages) | `[x]` | **Complete — issue #47, ADR-0007.** PR #48 (`2e539fa`): `wrangler.jsonc` + `public/_headers` (real CSP + `frame-ancestors 'none'`) + `deploy.yml` → CI-gate-only. PR #49 (`7144d34`): `scripts/nest-for-cloudflare.mjs` postbuild nesting (fixed live 404). Owner-verified live; Pages unpublished. |
| — | Second full Ultracode repo audit (analysis only) | `[x]` | **2026-07-09.** Report at [`audits/2026-07-09_ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md`](audits/2026-07-09_ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md); 71-agent fan-out + lead verification → **23 findings (F-101…F-123)**, 4 rejected, overall risk Medium. Filed **8 grouped issues #53–#60**. No code changed. |
| R | Audit-2 remediation — P0 gameplay blockers | `[x]` | **Both done.** **#53 — PR #62:** auto-succeed ability consumed once via shared `resolveCheckOutcome` (F-101); encounters route through the same unit (F-107). **#54 — PR #63:** Mayfair true ending de-crit-gated by dual-sourcing 2 clues (F-102) + a validator guard against crit-gated deduction clues. 554→564 tests. |
| R2 | Audit-2 remediation — P1 (code) | `[x]` | **Complete.** **#55 — PR #65:** save/reload safety — `saveGame` try/catch + error toast (F-103), persisted `encounterState` (v3→v4) so reload doesn't re-roll the reaction check (F-105); 569→577. **#56 — PR #64:** scene-transition hygiene (F-118/F-104/F-106/F-108); 564→569. **#57 — PR #66:** a11y/errors — React-19 `inert={bool}` (F-007 regression), ErrorBoundary auto-save claim gated, loading fallbacks `role=status`, + `evaluateCondition` own-property guard (fixed a pre-existing flaky determinism test); 577→588. |
| R2′ | Audit-2 remediation — P1 (docs #58) | `[x]` | **Done — PR #61 (`3dc49aa`).** F-119 `architecture.md` onEnter anti-pattern (+ F-013 flag drift); F-120 scene counts → 201; F-121 component count 16→17; F-122 choices/scene → ~1.77. Also closed the `.gitignore` `vite.config` emit-litter gap. Docs-only. |
| R3 | Audit-2 remediation — P2 test quality (#59) | `[x]` | **Done — PR #67 (`629df31`), test-only.** F-112–F-116 + 2 correctness cross-check gaps: replaced copy-of-logic/transitive/smoke tests with real-unit, **mutation-verified** guards — npcBounds→real slice clamps, new worldSlice reputation ±10, Nerve-vs-Lore tiebreak, direct `resolveScene` variant tests, real eviction (oldest evicted + autosave protected), `applyEffects` flag-false result, mundane vitality-only branch. No production code changed. 588→611 (+23), 56→58 files. |
| C1 | Content — The Comet Club (fourth main case) | `[x]` | **ADR-0011**, 2026-07-12: 75 scenes / 16 clues / 10 NPCs / 4 recipes; all review gates passed; **PR #76 merged** (8 cases live). |
| R3′ | Audit-2 remediation — P3 CI type-check (#60) | `[x]` | **Done — PR #68 (`98d3ac9`).** New `tsconfig.scripts.json` (non-composite + `noEmit`, `lib ES2023`, `types:["node"]`) covering `scripts/**/*.ts` + `vite.config.ts`; `typecheck:scripts` npm script chained into `build`; `tsconfig.node.json` given explicit `target/lib` to fix the `TS2550` at root; `@types/node@^20` devDep. A type error in the validator source now fails the build (was exit 0). Emnapi lockfile trap on first push → clean regen. Baseline unchanged (611). |
| U1 | UI/UX Phase 1 — global live announcer | `[x]` | **PR #80 merged**, 2026-07-14. `src/announcer.ts` + `<LiveAnnouncer>` at app root (`main.tsx`); `announce()` API. Substrate for Phases 2/3. 611/58 → 635/60. |
| U2a | UI/UX Phase 2a — deduction feedback legibility | `[x]` | **PR #82 merged (`63e4442`)**, 2026-07-15. `connected` 🔗 cue (WCAG 1.4.1); board-owned outcome banner via `announce()` (fixes button-unmount message loss); directional partial-tier copy. Legibility-only — formation unchanged, **ADR-0012 NOT enacted**. Spec took 3 Codex rounds → 2a/2b split. 635/60 → 649/61. |
| U4 | UI/UX Phase 4 — a11y hardening sweep | `[x]` | **MERGED — PR [#85](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/85) (`8e1c2b0`)**, 2026-07-17. Roadmap items 3/4/5 + preserve tests. SettingsPanel → shared `useFocusTrap`; title-screen `inert={isSettingsOpen}` (fixes Settings-over-title background-interactive bug); **fixed a pre-existing app-wide WCAG 2.4.3 bug — the `inert` ancestor blurred the invoker to `<body>` before the trap captured it, so all overlays restored focus to `<body>`; fixed via open-time `restoreFocusTo` capture** (found by whole-branch review, browser-confirmed). ALL keyboard focus rings → `focus-visible:ring-2 ring-amber-400` (~11 components, 2 documented exceptions), glob-driven tree-wide inventory guard; direct reduced-motion guards for every Motion gate (framer-motion mock) + structural CSS guard; preserve tests (focus-restore ×4, save-toast roles, keyboard connect, dice-as-status). Codex spec/plan/impl passes all folded (4+3 / 6+1 / 3). 733/74 → **766/78**.

Pure `deductionOracle.ts` classifies each player-connected component (`correct`/`false`/`partial`/`incorrect`); board forms every qualifying deduction (all matched recipes, Blocker 1); `DeductionButton` rolls only; `'connected'` derived from membership (N1); store-owned contested-revert with generation tokens; canonical stable generic-deduction id (N5); validator reserves the `deduction-generic-` namespace + clue-id charset; save v4→v5. Internal review + Codex impl pass (3 findings folded). 649/61 → **684/64**.

## Next actions (explicit order)

**UI/UX track — COMPLETE through Phase 4 (all merged).** Phase 4 (a11y hardening sweep) merged via PR
[#85](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/pull/85) (`8e1c2b0`); Phases 0/1/2a/2b/3 all merged
before it. No UI/UX work open. **The last roadmap item is Phase 5 — choice-gating content model**
(`visibility`/`gateReason` schema + validator rule + authoring-doc update). Per the roadmap's live caveat,
consider pulling it forward if content (The Orrery Room) resumes, so new authoring uses the
`hidden`/`disabled-with-reason` vocabulary from day one. **Otherwise content resumes:** The Orrery Room (Grey Dawn
vignette — fills the one missing faction vignette + consumes the live `mythos-period-computed` flag) is the natural
next build. No branch open; start the next piece from `main`.

**Audit-2 code backlog: CLEAR.** All of #53–#60 merged (PRs #62–#68). The only open GitHub issue is #20 (media,
user-blocked). No open code work. **#52 (agent-perspective interview) answered** 2026-07-09 — a first-person response to
all 11 questions is posted as a [comment on the issue](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/gaslight-and-grimoire/issues/52#issuecomment-4926364394)
(the blog draft itself is the user's to write; the issue can be closed once they've mined the answer).

**Content track (paused for UI/UX):** **The Comet Club is BUILT and MERGED** (PR #76,
[ADR-0011](DECISIONS/ADR-0011-comet-club-fourth-main-case.md)). When content resumes, suggested order from
[`content-ideas-2026-07-10.md`](content-ideas-2026-07-10.md): **The Orrery Room** (Grey Dawn vignette — fills the one
missing faction vignette AND consumes the now-live `mythos-period-computed` flag) → The Drowned Archive → The
Tidewaiter's Log. Small open decision from the build's reviews: three bookkeeping flags set but unread
(`cc-tonic-dissolved`, `cc-ost-confided`, `cc-midpoint-passed`) — wire or drop at next content session.

**Media track (partly user-blocked) — the practical next steps if resuming:**
1. **User generates the 10 ambient loops** (Stable Audio/Suno per [`audio-asset-kit.md`](audio-asset-kit.md)) into `public/audio/ambient/`, exact filenames. *(Unblocked; user step.)*
2. **Perceptual SFX QA (needs human ears)** — the 9 SFX load & trigger correctly in-browser (Playwright-verified), but whether they *sound* right (grounded/never-campy; occult stinger suitably uncanny) can't be machine-checked. One known duration outlier accepted: `clue-deduction` at 2.62s audible. *(User step.)*
3. **Build `scripts/checkAudioAssets.mjs`** (presence + content-cross-reference) + a unit test, then revisit CI wiring (likely `--strict`) once all files land. *(Best once ambient files land.)*

**Non-code:** #52 — **DONE** (agent's-perspective interview answered on the issue 2026-07-09). Remaining is the user's own
blog write-up for jonwhitefang.uk, plus optionally closing #52. The posted answer flags the overclaim traps to avoid
(Kiro origin, 198→201 scene count, two audits not one, "activated not built" deduction, invisible agent/human git line).

**Notes for whoever picks this up:** the audit's 4 rejected false positives are recorded in the report's *Rejected findings*
section — don't re-file them. Both audit backlogs (#1–#22 and #53–#60) are now fully cleared except the media milestone (#20).
The lockfile is fragile to incremental edits — see the emnapi trap in [[dependabot-major-group-migration]]; full-regen +
`npm ci` verify before pushing any dep change.

## Open questions / decisions pending

These are flagged-but-unresolved. Resolve each via an ADR when decided, then mark it RESOLVED with a link.

- ~~**How do we source and license media assets?**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 → [ADR-0006](DECISIONS/ADR-0006-media-asset-strategy.md).** AI-generate **audio only** via a prompt kit the user runs (no API in repo); illustrations parked at lowest priority. Naturalistic never-campy house style. Prompt kit authored: [`audio-asset-kit.md`](audio-asset-kit.md).
- **Audit-1 backlog** — 22 issues from the first Ultracode audit ([report](audits/ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md)); all cleared except #20 (media). 5 findings rejected by adversarial verification — don't re-file.
- **Audit-2 backlog (2026-07-09)** — 8 issues #53–#60 ([report](audits/2026-07-09_ULTRACODE_FULL_REPO_ANALYSIS.md), F-101…F-123). **All done (PRs #62–#68 merged).** 4 findings **rejected** by adversarial verification (report's *Rejected findings* section) — don't re-file.
- ~~**`.gitignore` gap:** `tsc -b` emitted `vite.config.js`/`.d.ts` from the composite `tsconfig.node.json` reference.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-09 → PR #61 (`3dc49aa`).** Gitignored the two artifacts. `noEmit` was ruled out — composite projects forbid it (TS6310, breaks `npm run build`); the plain `tsc` in the build path never emits them anyway, only `tsc -b` (IDE/build-mode) does.
