The man you have been hunting — a former Scotland Yard clerk named Aldgate, now in the employ of someone far above him — stands at the far end with a revolver and the look of a man who has run out of options. The cipher notes are stacked on a workbench beside him. Three murders. A cover-up that reaches to the Deputy Commissioner. And you, alone, in a cellar that smells of ink and old fear. How you end this is up to you.",
