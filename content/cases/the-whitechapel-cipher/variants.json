Inspector Graves meets you at the cordon — but so does a hooded figure who melts back into the fog the moment you step down. Someone in the Order knows you are here. 'Third one this month,' Graves says, handing you the cipher note. His eyes flick to where the figure stood. The symbols on the note are familiar to you now — you have seen their like in Order correspondence. That knowledge may prove useful.",
