# Gap Analysis

> Current state (from archaeology phases 1–9) vs desired state (from requirements, design doc, and roadmap).

---

## 1. Concepts Needing Implementation

Ordered by impact on the playable experience.

### 1.1 Load Game → Restore Case Data — ✅ FIXED (Phase A1)

**Resolution**: `metaSlice.loadGame` now calls `await loadCase(gameState.currentCase)` after restoring state and sets `caseData` in a second `set()` call.

---

### 1.2 Hint Engine Wiring — ✅ FIXED (Phase A3)

**Resolution**: `trackActivity` calls added to `NarrativePanel` (sceneChange), `EvidenceBoard` (boardVisit on mount, connectionAttempt on connection complete).

---

### 1.3 Archetype Ability Engine Integration — ✅ FIXED (Phase A4)

**Resolution**: Added `ABILITY_AUTO_SUCCEED_FLAGS` mapping in `narrativeEngine.ts`. `processChoice` checks for ability flags before `performCheck` — if set, returns `critical` tier without rolling.

---

### 1.4 Clue Discovery Card (MEDIUM)

**Gap**: `ClueDiscoveryCard` is a stub ("Full implementation in Task 10"). Auto-discovered clues are added to the store but the player gets no visual notification.

**Desired state**: Req 6.3 — slide-in card with type icon, title, summary, auto-dismiss after 4 seconds.

**What's needed**: Wire `NarrativePanel` to pass the most recently discovered clue and a visibility flag to `ClueDiscoveryCard`. Implement the slide-in animation (Framer Motion) and auto-dismiss timer.

**Effort**: ~30 lines across 2 files. Low risk.

**Files**: `src/components/NarrativePanel/ClueDiscoveryCard.tsx`, `src/components/NarrativePanel/NarrativePanel.tsx`

---

### 1.5 Encounter UI (MEDIUM)

**Gap**: The encounter engine (`startEncounter`, `processEncounterChoice`, `getEncounterChoices`) is fully implemented and tested. No UI component renders encounters. Players cannot experience encounters.

**Desired state**: Req 9.1–9.7 — multi-round encounters with reaction checks, faculty choices, and damage.

**What's needed**: Either a dedicated `EncounterPanel` component or integration into the existing `ChoicePanel`/`NarrativePanel` flow. Encounter state must be managed somewhere (component state or a new store slice). Scene content must include encounter-triggering scenes.

**Effort**: Significant — new component (~100–200 lines), encounter state management, content authoring for encounter scenes. Medium-high risk.

**Files**: New `src/components/EncounterPanel/` or modifications to `src/components/ChoicePanel/`, `src/components/NarrativePanel/`

---

### 1.6 Manual Save Button (LOW)

**Gap**: `metaSlice.saveGame()` exists and works but no UI element triggers it.

**Desired state**: Req 11.6 — manual save when auto-save is set to "manual".

**What's needed**: A save button in `HeaderBar` or `SettingsPanel`.

**Effort**: ~10 lines. Trivial risk.

**Files**: `src/components/HeaderBar/HeaderBar.tsx` or `src/components/SettingsPanel/SettingsPanel.tsx`

---

### 1.7 Case Completion Screen (LOW)

**Gap**: `CaseProgression.completeCase()` returns `{ facultyBonusGranted, vignetteUnlocked }` but no UI renders these results.

**Desired state**: Design doc §14.1 — after completing a case, show faculty advancement, new contacts, faction shifts, side case unlocks.

**What's needed**: A new screen or overlay in `App.tsx` that renders completion results before returning to the title screen or starting the next case.

**Effort**: New component (~50–100 lines), new screen state in `App.tsx`. Low risk.

**Files**: New `src/components/CaseCompletion/`, `src/App.tsx`

---

### 1.8 Faction Reputation Display (LOW)

**Gap**: Faction reputation is tracked and used for vignette unlocks but never shown to the player.

**Desired state**: Implied by Req 19 — players should understand their faction standing.

**What's needed**: A faction reputation section in `CaseJournal` or a dedicated panel.

**Effort**: ~20 lines added to `CaseJournal.tsx`. Trivial risk.

**Files**: `src/components/CaseJournal/CaseJournal.tsx`

---

### 1.9 Non-Automatic Clue Discovery Methods (LOW)

**Gap**: `ClueDiscovery.method` supports `'exploration'`, `'check'`, and `'dialogue'` but only `'automatic'` is handled in `NarrativePanel`.

**Desired state**: Req 6.1 — clues discovered through exploration choices, successful checks, and dialogue.

**What's needed**: These methods are implicitly handled by content design — an "exploration" clue would be gated by a choice that leads to a scene with an `onEnter` `discoverClue` effect. The `method` field is metadata, not a trigger mechanism. The gap is smaller than it appears — the content contract (Condition/Effect) already supports all discovery paths. What's missing is explicit UI for "Search the desk" style exploration choices within a scene.

**Effort**: Primarily a content authoring concern, not a code gap.

---

## 2. Architecture Changes Required

### 2.1 Break Engine → Store Circular Dependency

**Current**: `narrativeEngine.ts` and `caseProgression.ts` import `useStore` from the store. Store slices import from engine modules. This creates a bidirectional dependency.

**Required change**: Engine functions that currently call `useStore.getState()` should instead:
- Accept state as a parameter (already done for pure functions like `evaluateConditions`)
- Return effect descriptors that the caller applies to the store

**Incremental path**:
1. Extract `computeChoiceResult` from `processChoice` — pure function, no store access. Keep `processChoice` as a thin wrapper.
2. Move `applyOnEnterEffects` to a store action or a component-level helper that calls store actions.
3. Refactor `CaseProgression.completeCase` to return results without calling store actions directly.

**Risk**: Medium. Each step is independently deployable. The wrapper pattern preserves backward compatibility.

**Blocked by**: Nothing. Can start immediately.

---

### 2.2 ~~Extract SFX from Store Mutations~~ — ✅ FIXED (Phase B3)

**Resolution**: Created `src/store/audioSubscription.ts` with store subscription that detects state changes and triggers SFX. Initialized in `main.tsx`. Removed all `AudioManager.playSfx` calls from slice files.

---

### 2.3 Deduplicate GameState Snapshot Builders — ✅ FIXED (Phase A2)

**Resolution**: Created `src/utils/gameState.ts` with single `snapshotGameState` function. `store/index.ts` re-exports as `buildGameState`. All 4 duplicate sites now import from the shared util.

---

### 2.4 ~~Move `buildDeduction` to Engine Layer~~ — ✅ FIXED (Phase B2)

**Resolution**: Moved `src/components/EvidenceBoard/buildDeduction.ts` → `src/engine/buildDeduction.ts`. Updated imports in `DeductionButton.tsx` and the property test.

---

## 3. Technical Debt Blocking Progress

### 3.1 ~~`loadGame` Doesn't Restore `caseData`~~ — ✅ FIXED

Fixed in Phase A1. `loadGame` now calls `loadCase(gameState.currentCase)` after state restoration.

---

### 3.2 ~~Ability Flags Not Read by Engine~~ — ✅ FIXED

Fixed in Phase A4. `processChoice` checks `ABILITY_AUTO_SUCCEED_FLAGS` before `performCheck`.

---

### 3.3 ~~Hint Tracking Not Wired~~ — ✅ FIXED

Fixed in Phase A3. `trackActivity` calls added to `NarrativePanel` and `EvidenceBoard`.

---

### 3.4 ~~`processChoice` Impurity~~ — ✅ FIXED (Phase B1)

Fixed in Phase B1. Extracted `computeChoiceResult` as a pure function. `processChoice` is now a thin wrapper.

---

### 3.5 ~~Outcome Tier Completeness Not Validated~~ — ✅ FIXED (Phase B5)

Fixed in Phase B5. Both `validateContent` and `validateCase.mjs` now check that faculty-check choices have all 5 outcome tiers. `validateContent` is called at runtime in `loadAndStartCase`.

---

## 4. What Can Be Incrementally Improved

These are ordered by effort (smallest first) and can each be a single PR.

| # | Improvement | Effort | Files | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~Fix `loadGame` to restore `caseData`~~ | ✅ DONE | `metaSlice.ts` | — |
| 2 | ~~Wire hint `trackActivity` calls~~ | ✅ DONE | `EvidenceBoard.tsx`, `NarrativePanel.tsx` | — |
| 3 | ~~Add ability flag check in `processChoice`~~ | ✅ DONE | `narrativeEngine.ts` | — |
| 4 | ~~Deduplicate `snapshotGameState` → shared `buildGameState`~~ | ✅ DONE | `utils/gameState.ts` + 5 files | — |
| 5 | ~~Move `buildDeduction` to engine layer~~ | ✅ DONE | `engine/buildDeduction.ts` | — |
| 6 | Add manual save button | ~10 lines | `HeaderBar.tsx` | Trivial |
| 7 | Add faction reputation to CaseJournal | ~20 lines | `CaseJournal.tsx` | Trivial |
| 8 | ~~Add outcome tier completeness to validators~~ | ✅ DONE | `validateCase.mjs`, `narrativeEngine.ts` | — |
| 9 | Implement ClueDiscoveryCard | ~30 lines | `ClueDiscoveryCard.tsx`, `NarrativePanel.tsx` | Low |
| 10 | ~~Extract `computeChoiceResult` pure function~~ | ✅ DONE | `narrativeEngine.ts` | — |
| 11 | ~~Create audio subscription (extract SFX from slices)~~ | ✅ DONE | `audioSubscription.ts` + 3 slices | — |
| 12 | Add case completion screen | ~80 lines | New component + `App.tsx` | Low |
| 13 | Encounter UI component | ~150–200 lines | New component | Med |

Items 1–3 fix broken features. Items 4–8 are cleanup. Items 9–13 are new features.

---

## 5. What Requires a Rewrite

### Nothing requires a full rewrite.

The architecture is sound in its fundamentals:
- The type system is comprehensive and consistent (~220 lines, single file, used everywhere).
- The Zustand + Immer store pattern is well-executed (6 clean slices, selector hooks, action hooks).
- The Condition/Effect content contract is the right abstraction (8 condition types, 7 effect types, AND logic).
- The component directory convention is followed without exception.
- The content/engine separation is enforced.

The issues are all incremental:
- **Broken features** (load game, hints, abilities) are 3–10 line fixes each.
- **Architectural violations** (engine↔store coupling, SFX in mutations) can be fixed by extracting pure functions and adding a subscription layer — no existing code needs to be deleted, only wrapped.
- **Missing features** (encounter UI, case completion, clue discovery card) are additive — they don't require changing existing code, only adding new components.

### Partial rewrites to consider (not urgent)

**`narrativeEngine.ts` decomposition**: At 400+ lines with 6 responsibilities (loading, conditions, scenes, effects, choices, encounters), this file would benefit from splitting into focused modules. But it works correctly and the functions are well-documented. This is a "when it gets painful" refactor, not a "do it now" one.

**Hint engine → Zustand slice**: The module-level singleton with `Date.now()` calls is architecturally inconsistent. Moving hint state into the store would make it testable, persistable, and consistent with everything else. But the current implementation works (once wired), and the `_setState` test helpers are an adequate workaround. This is a "nice to have" refactor.

## Risk Summary

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Load game blank screen ships to users~~ | ~~High~~ | ~~Critical~~ | ✅ Fixed in Phase A1 |
| Content author adds choice with missing outcome tier | Medium | High — runtime crash | Fix #8: add tier completeness validation |
| ~~Ability activation appears to work but does nothing~~ | ~~High~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ Fixed in Phase A4 |
| New engine logic added to impure `processChoice` | Medium | Medium — untestable | Fix #10: extract pure `computeChoiceResult` |
| Audio files added but SFX timing is wrong due to Immer batching | Low (Immer doesn't batch today) | Low | Fix #11: audio subscription |

## Unknowns

1. **Content volume**: The engine supports arbitrary cases but only one exists. The architecture's scalability claims (normalized state, flat maps, variant system) are untested at scale. Adding 3–5 more cases would be the real stress test.

2. **Encounter content**: The encounter engine exists but no case content uses encounter-type scenes. It's unclear whether the current case JSON structure can express encounters or if the content schema needs extension.

3. **Cross-case persistence**: The vignette unlock system and variant scene system are implemented but untestable with only one main case. The `loadAndStartCase` function doesn't clear old clues/NPCs before loading new ones — starting a second case would merge state from both.

4. **Mobile performance**: The app targets browsers broadly but has never been tested on mobile. The `html5: false` Howler config may block audio on mobile Safari without user interaction. The Evidence Board's mouse-tracking ghost thread has no touch equivalent.

5. **Save file size at scale**: With 10 manual saves + autosave, each containing clues/NPCs/flags from multiple cases, localStorage's ~5MB limit could be reached. No monitoring or warning exists.
